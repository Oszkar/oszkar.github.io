        <p class="mb-3">I worked in various environments; early-stage startup, mid-size company, goverment, multinational corporations. My current interest are autonomy,
          spacecrafts, home automation and the software that drives these. I'm also interested in deep tech startups and disruption. During the past few years I've been focusing on growing
          experience in product and people management. I have experience in growing teams from 1 to 40+ and delivering products from scratch to $100M+ in revenue both as an engineer and as product manager.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">I love clean code, beautifully architected software, and comprehensive documentation. Though not actively coding at the moment, I still consider myself as an engineer
          but I am strategically trying myself in various roles to expand my skills and experience. As a bit of a joker, I always try to bring cheer and fun to my teams.</p>

        <p>When not working, I enjoy traveling, taking photos of random things, exploring the city, trying new food places or riding my motorbike.</p>
        <p>My technical interests outside of work are home automation, space exploration, airplanes, cars and motorbikes.</p>
